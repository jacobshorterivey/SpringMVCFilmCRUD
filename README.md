## Spring MVC Film C.R.U.D. Project

### Week 8 Homework Project for Skill Distillery

### Overview
For week 8, we were given the assignment of creating a web application that was able to query a database of films, in order to display select films and their details on a web page. The query results would include things like a film's rating, length, special features, and language. The user would also have the ability search for films by ID or keyword, and also edit and delete those films directly from the results webpage.

### Technologies/Topics Applied
The technologies we focused on using this project were Spring MVC, DAOs, controllers, JSPs, and JSTL. We implemented full C.R.U.D., and deployed our site to AWS. There was also a large focus on collaboration and pair programming.

### Lessons Learned
This project was a pair project, so it was important to communicate goals and objectives effectively. Managing our time was vital, as was knowing when to ask for assistance. Learning how DAOs, controllers, and HTMLs/JSPs interact was challenging, but things clicked eventually.
