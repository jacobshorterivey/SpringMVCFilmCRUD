## MVC Film Site Project

### Week 8 Homework Project for Skill Distillery

### Overview

This is a team project: you will collaborate with your teammates to complete this project. One teammate will own the Github repository that the rest of the team will share.

Your application will implement full web-based C.R.U.D. functionality, using Spring MVC and the DAO pattern. The DAO implementation will use JDBC to persist and retrieve data.

### How to Run
Run the app on server. Navigate the website and follow the prompts.

### Technologies/Topics Used
Continuing to dive deeper into SQL. Now we are doing full C.R.U.D. And we are now using Spring Tool Suite. Uploading the site to AWS EC2.


### Lessons Learned
The puzzle pieces are definitely starting to come together. After looking at this DAO pattern for a couple of weeks now, it makes a lot more since of how all of the working parts function together. Want to improve on the bootstrap / css side of things so we can make the sites more presentable, but either way, it's great to be able to create a more or less fully functioning website from scratch that has some pretty powerful database capabilities.

Collaborating as a team on this project added an interesting dimension as well. It was nice being able to divide the workload and be able to bounce ideas off of one another Especially, if we ran into problems, it was quite helpful to have another set of eyes to look at the code.
